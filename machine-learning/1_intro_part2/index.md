### What is Statistical Learning?

![](linreg1.png)

- Problem: estimate sales based on TV, Radio, or Newspaper ad fees
- Shown are <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Sales</span> vs <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">TV</span>, <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Radio</span> and <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Newspaper</span>, with a blue linear-regression line fit separatly to each.
- Can we Predict Sales using these three?
- Perhaps we can do better using a model

$$Sales \approx f(TV, Radio, Newspaper)$$


### Notation

- Here Sales is a <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">response or target</span> that we wish to predict. We generically refer to the response as Y . 
- TV is a feature, or input, or predictor; we name it X1. 
- Likewise name Radio as X2, and so on. 
- We can refer to the input vector collectively as

$$X =\left(\begin{array}{c}X_1\\ X_2\\X_3\end{array}\right)$$

- Now we write our model as

$$Y= f(X) +\epsilon$$

- where $$\epsilon$$ captures measurement errors and other discrepancies.

### How to implement f(X)?

- With a good $$f$$ we can make predictions of $$Y$$ at new points $$X = x$$. 
- We can understand which components of $$X = (X_1, X_2,...,X_p)$$ are important in explaining $$Y$$ , and which are irrelevant. e.g. Seniority and Years of Education have a big impact on Income, but Marital Status typically does not.
- Depending on the complexity of $$f$$, we may be able to understand how each component $$X_j$$ of $$X$$ aï¬€ects $$Y$$.
- The following scatter plot shows a connection between y and x (not pure random).

Is there an ideal $$f(X)$$? In particular, what is a good value for $$f(X)$$ at any selected value of $$X$$, say $$X = 4$$? There can be many $$Y$$ values at $$X = 4$$. A good value is


$$f(4) = E(Y|X = 4)$$

- The following means expected value average of $$Y$$ given $$X = 4$$.

$$E(Y|X = 4)$$

- The following is called the regression function:

$$f(x) = E(Y|X = x)$$
