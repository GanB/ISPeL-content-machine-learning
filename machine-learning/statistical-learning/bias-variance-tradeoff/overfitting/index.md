title: Overfitting
---

- Overfitting is the production of an analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data (training) and may therefore fail to fit additional data or predict future observations (testing) reliably. (wiki)

#### Overfitting issue: 
- a model works very well for training data but performance is very bad for testing data.
- Key reason: model noise in the data.
