There are many sentence patterns defined within a language.  Some familiar types of sentence patterns are

1. **question** "What is the date of today?"
2. **command** "Complete this assignment by Monday."
3. **exclamation** "It is Friday!"
4. **subjective sentences** "Tennis is the best sport."
5. **objective sentences, statements** "The first President of the United States was George Washington."

Objective statements have either True or False. The truth of the statement can either be validated by referencing a defintion that
is universally accepted or from the direct implication of an axiom (a statement of true conditions) or another statement that has been shown to be true.

In this module, we focus on objective statements.
