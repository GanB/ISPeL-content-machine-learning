title: Linear Regression
---

- Linear regression is a simple approach to supervised learning. It assumes that the dependence of Y on $$X_1,X_2,...X_p$$ is linear.

- True regression functions are never linear!

- Although it may seem overly simplistic, linear regression is extremely useful both conceptually and practically.

#### Questions we might ask:
- Is there a relationship between advertising budget and sales?
- How strong is the relationship between advertising budget and sales?
- Which media contributes to sales?
- How accurately can we predict future sales?
- Is the relationship linear?
- Is there synergy among the advertising media?
