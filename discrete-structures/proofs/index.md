title: Preliminaries for Mathematical Proofs

<span class="newthought">A proof</span> is a logical argument constructed with the goal of universally establishing the validity of a statement.
This learning module contains an introduction to proofs beginning with differentiating between statements that have only a true or false value and other constructs.  The learner can then explore the translation of statements into the language of Mathematics and Symbolic Logic and the different types of proof techniques commonly used in the fields of Computer Science and Mathematics.
