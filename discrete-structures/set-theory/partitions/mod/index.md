title: Modular Arithmetic, Relations and Partitions
---


Modular Arithmetic is a topic that acts as a common thread running through the topics of discrete structures.  

**Student Project**:  For your choice of prime number $$p > 3$$, let $$S = \{ 0, 1, 2, \ldots, p-1\}.$$  Illustrate the concepts of Partitions, Power Sets and Relations:

1. Find the Power Set of $$S$$, $$\mathcal{P}(S)$$ and the cardinality of $$\mathcal{P}(S).$$

2. Define a relation on $$S$$ that satisfies the properties of an equivalence relation.  What are the subsets of the partition of $$S$$ generated by 
your relation?


Modular Arithmetic is also used in Computer Science applications...go into bitwise addition on the set $$\{0, 1\}$$ and the set of all 4-bit words...

In Progress!
