Relevant topics and the dependencies between topics have been identified. The prerequisites for topics have been integrated into the layout of the material so that learners can personalize their path of study within each topic.  

As a guide to the learner, each module below begins with an Introduction that describes the preliminaries for the topic and this is where we suggest that every learner should begin.  {% include sidenote.html id="note-pgm" note="The materials presented are based on the ontology constructed by [Dr. Venkat Gudivada](http://www.cs.ecu.edu/gudivada/),  [Dr. Kelle Clark]() and other research members of the ISPeL System Project Team funded by the [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov) as part of the [PPSE](https://ppse.ecu.edu/)" %}


A learner can proceed as they are inclined within the module to create their own path among the topics.   The concepts within the modules are intended to be discovered in any order.

## Proofs 

This learning module contains an introduction to proofs beginning with differentiating between statements that have a true or false value and other constructs.  The leaner can then explore the translation of statements into the language of Mathematics and Symbolic Logic and the different types of proof techniques commonly used in the fields of Computer Science and Mathematics.  A proof is a logical argument constructed with the goal of universally establishing the validity of a statement.

1. [Introduction](proofs/intro/)

2. [Statements](proofs/statements/) 

3. [Types of Proofs](proofs/types/)

4. [Translation of Statements and Symbolic Logic](proofs/trans/)

## Functions

Functions are rules used to map one set of objects to another set of objects.  These rules help to describe events that occur like the trends in the stock market, the spread of viruses, the expected run time of computer programs and much more.  Functions allow us to model observed behavior, identify pattens and produce information that can be used to solve problems and support solutions.

1. [Introduction](functions/intro/)

2. [Properties of Functions](functions/properties/)

3. [Permutations](functions/permutations/)

4. [Operations on Functions](functions/operations/)

5. [Modular Arithmetic](functions/mod/)


## Set Theory

Data is mounting everywhere from the sale, purchase and inventory information of retail to the generation of personal health records.  In general terms, each collection of data is a set.  Set theory covers the interaction of collection of sets and operations that can be performed on the sets.

2. [Properties of Sets](set-theory/properties/)

3. [Operations on Sets](set-theory/operations/) 

4. [Partitions and Relations](set-theory/partitions/)

5. [Modular Arithmetic](set-theory/mod/)

2. [Combinations](counting-methods/combinations/)

3. [Permutations](counting-methods/permutations/)


## Probability

2. [Random Variables](probability/random-var/)

3. [Outcome Space](probability/outcome-space/)
