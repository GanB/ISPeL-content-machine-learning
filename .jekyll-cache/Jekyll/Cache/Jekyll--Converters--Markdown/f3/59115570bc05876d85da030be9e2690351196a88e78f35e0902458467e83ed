I"a<p>Modular Arithmetic is a topic that acts as a common thread running through the topics of discrete structures.</p>

<p><strong>Student Project</strong>:  For your choice of prime number \(p &gt; 3\), let \(S = \{ 0, 1, 2, \ldots, p-1\}.\)  Illustrate the concepts of Partitions, Power Sets and Relations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Find the Power Set of \(S\), \(\mathcal{P}(S)\) and the cardinality of \(\mathcal{P}(S).\)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Define a relation on \(S\) that satisfies the properties of an equivalence relation.  What are the subsets of the partition of \(S\) generated by 
your relation?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Modular Arithmetic is also used in Computer Science applications…go into bitwise addition on the set \(\{0, 1\}\) and the set of all 4-bit words…</p>

<p>In Progress!</p>
