<p>The site is designed to be a reference for essential definitions, concepts, examples and practice problems in an environment that allows each learner to personalize their experience within a non-course-centric curriculum.  To the extent possible, prerequisites for topics have been integrated within the topic’s development.  Your collaboration is welcomed with the aim to make this site a valuable learning resource. <label for="mn-construction" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-construction" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The notes are still <strong>under construction</strong> and are developed with the intention of providing an open resource for both educators and learners.  The content is not without typos, and the authors have done their best to present quality information. If you see areas for improvement, please let us know or submit a pull request with your fixes to our <a href="https://github.com/vngudivada/ISPeL-content-discrete-structures/tree/development">GitHub repository</a>.</span></p>

<p>Each module outlined in the Overview of Machine Learning below begins with an Introduction.   The authors’ recommend that new learners begin with the study of the preliminaries presented in an Introduction section before investigating other concepts in the module. <label for="note-pgm" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="note-pgm" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The materials presented are based on the ontology constructed by <a href="http://www.cs.ecu.edu/wu/">Dr. Rui Wu</a>,  <a href="">Grayson Blankenship-undergrad</a> and other research members of the ISPeL System Project Team funded by the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov">NSF</a> as part of the <a href="https://ppse.ecu.edu/">PPSE</a></span></p>
