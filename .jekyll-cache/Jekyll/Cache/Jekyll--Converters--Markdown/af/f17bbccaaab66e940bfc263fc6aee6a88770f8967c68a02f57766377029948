  <li>With unsupervised learning there is no outcome variable, just a set of predictors (features) measured on a set of samples.</li>
  <li>Objective is more fuzzy: find groups of samples that <font color="red"> behave similarly</font>, find features that behave similarly, find linear combinations of features with the most variation.

  Data is grouped or clustered together based off of a similarity between data points.

  <li>
    <p>Different from supervised learning but can be useful as a<font color="red"> pre-processing</font> step for supervised learning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Key difference: predict the cluster of a data record without predicting an explicit label</li>
  <li>Possible method: calculate distance between each data record, if closer =&gt; the same cluster.</li>
